### Welcome to Frank's Github!! 👋

**Hello and welcome to my personal GitHub.**

# About Me
I am a junior programmer who is still learning in the world of game development and programming.
This is where I upload the source code of game projects and applications that I've worked on for open-source purposes or simply as a safe storage space.
